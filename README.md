"# Hotel_TULIP_Weblog" 

Hotel TULIP (a hypothetical organisation) is a five star hotel that locates in Australia. It is a very special hotel with an equally special purpose: Not only does it embody all the creative energy and spirit of TULIP-Lab, it’s a “learning environment” on which the tourism and hospitality students are trained for future hoteliers.

In the past two decades, the Web server of Hotel TULIP has logged all the web traffic to the hotel website, and stored large amount of data related to the use of various web pages. 

The hotel’s CIO, Dr Bear Guts (not Bill Gates!), believes that those log files are great resources to help their Information Technology Division improve their potential customers’ online experience, and help their Market Promotion Division to identify potential customers and their behaviour patterns. 

Hence, Hotel TULIP would like to outsource the web usage mining task to analyse web log files and discover user accessing patterns of different web pages.

The Web server is using Microsoft Internet Information Service (IIS), and the Web log format
